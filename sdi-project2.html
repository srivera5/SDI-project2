<p>Javascript coding only got trickier. </p>
<p>For this assignment I chose to stick with the cooking idea because on a basic level, it's sometimes involves easy procedures that can be broken down into simple steps.</p>
<p>For example, with my assignment, I continued on with my French Toast story. Each function in javascript was basically just another step on how I would prepare this meal.</p>
